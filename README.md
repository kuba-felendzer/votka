# votka
**A custom voting bot built for a server**

## Usage

`:d`: lists out your options (Candidate A: `v 1`, `:v a`) with a number and letter

`:v <num>`: lets you vote once for a candidate using their number or letter. if you cast a valid vote (`:v 1`), you cannot vote again.

`:t`: lists the tally of the votes, with each person's votes and the total listed, and timestamped
